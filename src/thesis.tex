        A number of people helped me throughout these years of my masters education at
        Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Starting from professors who were always delivering
        their knowledge in the best possible way, lecturers, and administrative staff at the University,
        I would like to thank everyone who played some role in my education during these years.
        The Computer Science Department is for sure one of the best at the University,
        and it met all of my expectations.

        I express my sincere gratitude to my mentor Prof. Fabio Pittarello for being
        supportive, patient, and helpful during this time. He played a significant role in
        delivering the thesis in the best possible way.

        I cannot forget to thank all of my friends and colleagues that were here with me
        during my studies. We had a lot of fun and created some beautiful memories
        which will be cherished forever. Their friendship is one of the most important things
        I will take with me while leaving these doors behind me.

        The last words of thanks go to my family and people who helped me in any kind of
        way during my education. If it were not for them, I would not have been able to accomplish
        all of this. Their unselfish support was present all the time and helped me in the
        toughest moments. I hope I get to return all of this to them one day.

    \begin{abstract}
        Visualizing information correctly and in a useful way is a difficult task in computer science. Information is
        collected from many subject fields, and presenting it purposefully can often be challenging for a scientist or
        a researcher. Not only does one have to transform the raw data into something more comprehensible, but do it
        in a way that makes concepts more familiar. One of the most important tasks that need to be
        fulfilled is presenting data in a proper way, compliant with the users' background and skills, in
        order to permit them to form a mental model of the subject.

        The subject field of this master's thesis is art, specifically artists and their lives, investigated through
        computer science. This research will try to capture the life of an artist using specific information
        visualization techniques, even enhancing the already seen ones to adjust them to this special subject field. It will
        focus on spatio-temporal visualization techniques, adapting them to the art field, and in the end, implementing
        all research work into an augmented reality prototype. The goal is to combine computer science and arts by
        presenting users, like art experts, visitors of an art exhibition or a museum, with an innovative way of learning about the
        life of an artist, summarizing the most important parts of their lives with meaningful and interactive information
        visualization techniques.
