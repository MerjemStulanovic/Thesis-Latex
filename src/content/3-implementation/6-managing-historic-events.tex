\section{Managing Historic Events}\label{sec:managing-historic-events}
The \emph{Manage historic events} page's functionality is to give the user the possibility to enter information on historic events. The list of
events is presented on the main page. Each event can be edited or deleted as well. Historic event entries show where and when the event took place. This
functionality is related to entering information on historic events that may have influenced artists' lives or work. They are not directly
associated to artists, but presenting them in the cube might give us an insight on what events possibly impacted artists' lives. Some of them might
have triggered a migration of artists to other cities or caused a change in their artistic works. Exploring the relationship between these
historic events and artists' lives gives experts additional interest in why changes happened in the first place.

This concludes the first part of the visualization -- entering data about the artist's life. The next step is running the
visualization. Firstly, visualizing the cube in the browser will be presented, and then the AR version of the visualization.
