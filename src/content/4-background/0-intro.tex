This chapter will briefly introduce  technical background used for the implementation part of the thesis. We chose the space-time cube
representation for documenting an artistâ€™s life, and we opted to present this visualization in web and mobile applications. The web
application allows the user to explore the cube in any browser, whereas the option for the mobile part was implemented as an AR (augmented
reality) prototype. The architecture for this thesis is a frontend + backend architecture with communication over the HTTPS protocol. Below we
will list technologies used for both the frontend and the backend part.

Frontend:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Angular
    \item Three.js
    \item WebXR
\end{itemize}

Backend:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spring Framework
\end{itemize}
