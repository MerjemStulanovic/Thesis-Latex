\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}
The lack of visualizations for investigating artists’ lives is the problem this research will try to deal with and strive to provide a potential
solution to. Even though the information about how artists lived, worked, and everything else has been available in written form, aggregating and
converting that raw data into a visual representation has not been explored much. Partly because of the difficulty of putting one's life in
a comprehensive representation.

Humans are complex creatures and their lives are full of situations and experiences that shape them or change their life course. We need to
address the ones which crossed the life of an artist and present them in a meaningful way in this thesis. The purpose of this work is to improve the
previously seen space-time cube visualization and implement it as an augmented reality prototype. The space-time cube provides a great
foundation for presenting a person’s life, since its three dimensions allow for an exploration of both spatial and temporal properties.
