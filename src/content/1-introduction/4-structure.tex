\section{Structure}\label{sec:structure}
The structure of the work is divided into six chapters. \Cref{ch:literature-review} presents previous work and research in
information visualization, especially related to cultural heritage and the artists' lives. \Cref{ch:implementation} covers all the
work we have done in our implementation, describes the web application, how to use it, shows examples of it, and everything else
related to the prototype. \Cref{ch:background} briefly covers the technologies used for the implementation and gives insight into how and where
can we use them. \Cref{ch:evaluation} gives an evaluation of the visualization. In the last chapter, \Cref{ch:conclusion}, we conclude and sum up
what was done and mention future work plans.
