We are surrounded by information everywhere, especially nowadays, as it is available to us in a blink of an eye. What once used to be a
difficult task, today is one of the easiest -- accessing and gathering any kind of data. But what can we understand from just looking at the raw
data? And does everyone grasp a piece of information in the same way, or does it appear puzzling to some? The beauty of information
visualization lies right here. We can create stories and transform plain letters and numbers into something engaging and easily understandable.
Using our imagination, we explore dimensions and colors, combine plots and charts or break them apart. The possibilities are endless.

This research will be focused on presenting the life of an artist using information visualization techniques. We will explore already seen ones
and ways it was done before, and apply everything learned to our own visualization type. The main goal is to try to extract the most important
parts of an artist's life, especially their activity through space and time, and visually present them in an interesting and appealing way. This
will later be combined with the augmented reality experience which will add additional significance to the whole concept.
